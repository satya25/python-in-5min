What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data values. Think of them as labels you attach to data so you can reference it later in your code.

python

Copy
# This is a variable named 'x' that stores the value 5
x = 5

Naming Conventions
There are some rules and best practices for naming variables in Python:

Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), but not with a number.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).

Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different).

Examples:

python

Copy
my_variable = 10    # Valid variable name
myVariable = "Hello" # Valid variable name using camelCase
_my_var = 3.14      # Valid variable name starting with an underscore
2myvar = 20         # Invalid variable name; starts with a number
Assigning Values to Variables
Assigning a value to a variable is straightforward. Use the = operator to assign values.

python

Copy
# Assigning integer value to a variable
age = 25

# Assigning string value to a variable
name = "Alice"

# Assigning float value to a variable
pi = 3.14159

# Assigning boolean value to a variable
is_student = True

# Printing the values
print("Age:", age)
print("Name:", name)
print("PI:", pi)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
Key Points:

Variables can hold different types of data: integers, strings, floats, booleans, etc.

You can change the value of a variable at any time.

Quick Exercise: Try creating a few variables of different types and print their values. Change the values and print them again to see how variable assignments work.

Code Example:

python

Copy
# Creating variables
favorite_color = "Blue"
num_apples = 5
average_grade = 89.5

# Printing the variables
print("Favorite Color:", favorite_color)
print("Number of Apples:", num_apples)
print("Average Grade:", average_grade)

# Changing the values
favorite_color = "Green"
num_apples = 7
average_grade = 92.3

# Printing the updated variables
print("Updated Favorite Color:", favorite_color)
print("Updated Number of Apples:", num_apples)
print("Updated Average Grade:", average_grade)
